            <h2>Version control</h2>
            <p>Version control is a way of managing changes to codebase. It enables developers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Switch between different versions of the code (e.g. for different features)</li>
                <li>See how the codebase has changed over time, and the reasons for those changes</li>
                <li>Make collaborative decisions over which changes to keep</li>
                <li>Rollback to an older version, if something breaks</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Git</h2>
            <p>Git is a free, open source version control system. It's been the most widely-used version control system for many years.</p>
            <p>It was developed by Linus Torvalds, who named the project after himself &#129315;.</p>
            <p>To commit changes to a github repository using GitHub Desktop:</p>

                <li>Write a description</li>
                <li>Click the "commit" button</li>
            </ol>
